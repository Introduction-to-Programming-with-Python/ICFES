# ICFES

This project aims to apply some programming foundations concepts and Python functionalities applied to a data analyzer and visualizer program.

## Respository structure

- The folder [code](/code/) contains the code of this project.
- The folder [documentation](/documentation/) contains the repository documentation files about this project.
- The file [data](/data.csv) is data source for this project. This file is a reduced file of the data, if you want a largest file, contact me.

## Context

This [document](/documentation/statement.pdf) contains the context of the problem, requirments and functionality for each file and function.

## Objectives

This project aims to apply the following functionalities:

- Implement algorithms to build and traverse matrices.
- Use the [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) and [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) libraries.

## How does it work?

Once you execute the application, the options will be displayed by the console and you can start to navegate and interact with the program with the console. The responses will be showed in a [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) window or in the console.

The file [consola_ICFES.py](/code/consola_ICFES.py) has one function for each requirment executing the neccesary functions from the file [resultados_icfes.py](/code/resultados_icfes.py) that help to solve the requirments.

You need to have installed [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) and [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) libraries.


## Execution

To execute the program you have to execute the [consola_ICFES.py](/code/consola_ICFES.py) file.

Before any other option, in each execution you have to execute the option 1 to load the data file and be able to continue with the others. Once you execute the option 1 you should type the data file name, it is "data".

Before execute the options 10, 11, 12 and 13 you have to execute the option 9 due to this option create a data strucuture necessary por the next options.

To exit of the program type 14 and enter.
